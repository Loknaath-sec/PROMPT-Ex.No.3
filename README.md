### Aim: To design an AI-powered chatbot that assists customers in resolving issues related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The chatbot should handle various customer queries efficiently while maintaining a conversational and user-friendly tone. In this experiment, we will employ different prompt patterns to guide the development process of the chatbot, ranging from basic task-oriented prompts to more complex, persona-driven prompts. Case study 1 with Straightforward Prompts, Tabular Format Prompting and Preceding Question Prompting  

### Explanation - Any one use case from Unit 5 and generate the report for that with the unit 2 Prompt type

## 1. Define the Scenario and Use Case

## Scenario
In today‚Äôs food and hospitality sector, there is a growing emphasis on providing nutritional clarity and tailored meal suggestions. To support this, an AI-driven chatbot can be introduced to deliver fast and well-structured dietary insights. The chatbot will offer:

* Detailed nutrient information (calories, protein, fats, carbs)
* Allergen notifications
* Health-conscious alternatives
* Side-by-side dish comparisons

This enables users to make smarter food choices while improving overall interaction and satisfaction.

## Target Audience
Restaurants and cafeterias with digital menu systems
Individuals focused on fitness and healthy eating
Nutrition experts and diet planners who need quick nutritional references

## 2. Main Objectives

* Present nutritional details of food items in a clear format
* Enable structured comparisons across different meals
* Recommend alternatives tailored to diets (e.g., diabetic-friendly, weight-loss, protein-rich)
* Ensure the chatbot communicates in a simple, conversational manner

## 3. Identify Prompt Patterns for Each Design Aspect

## Prompt Pattern 1: Idea Generation
Prompt Example:
üëâ ‚ÄúWhat features can be integrated into the nutrition chatbot to guide customers better?‚Äù

Resulting Ideas:
* Show calories, proteins, fats, carbs, and micronutrients
* Highlight allergen details (nuts, gluten, dairy, soy)
* Allow item-to-item nutritional comparison
* Suggest healthier or personalized meal substitutes
* Present calorie distribution visually (charts/graphs)

## Prompt Pattern 2: Persona & Usage Context

* Output Style: Clear, tabular, and visually appealing format
* Ease of Access: Usable even by non-technical users

## Prompt Pattern 3: Direct Queries
Prompt Example:
üëâ ‚ÄúProvide the nutrition details of a Paneer Wrap.‚Äù

Generated Response:
* Dish Name: Grilled Chicken Salad
